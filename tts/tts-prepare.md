# tts-prepare

## Overview
This userscript prepares web page content for text-to-speech (TTS) applications, improving accessibility for users who rely on screen readers or TTS tools.

## How it works
- Cleans up and restructures page content for better TTS parsing.
- Highlights or isolates main content sections.
- Rewrites censored words (swears, profanes, ...)
- Rewrites for better pronunciation of some words (Gu => Goo, ...)
